# Welcome

Hi ! I'm Gandal Foglia. Apparently, you have stumbled upon my personal website. If you searched for it, it is likely that you know me. If not, let me introduce myself:

## Who am I?

I am a future 20 years old student in economics at HEC Lausanne, in Switzerland.

## Why did I create this website?

I always wanted to create my own website. I'm using it as my resume for now. For the tech-savvy among you, this site was designed with Retype as well as GitHub Pages. I feel like it looks better than a WordPress website. In reality, Retype is better for creating documentations but still, it works !
