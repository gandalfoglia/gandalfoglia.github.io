# Welcome

Hi ! I'm Gandal Foglia. Apparently, you have stumbled upon my personal website. If you searched for it, it is likely that you know me. If not, let me introduce myself:

## Who am I?

I am a 20 years old student in computer science at EPFL, in Switzerland.

## Why did I create this website?

I always wanted to create my own website. I'm using it as my resume for now and it was built using Retype as well as GitHub Pages. It's more original and fun to use than WordPress, without having to code a whole site from scratch. Actually, Retype is better for creating documentations but it still works in this case in my opinion.
