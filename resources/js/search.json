So I presented a speech to local schools and with their great cooperation we shared ideas worth spreading to 250 students aged 14 to 19. Everything went well, except for the fact that we started the show ten minutes late. The schools we worked with loved the show and wanted to come again the following year. The most beautiful compliment they could tell us.","The event took place at the Alambic theater and the show was 1 hour and 30 minutes long.","It was a Friday and hopefully we have been able to skip school for that day (with the authorization of the direction, of course).","Here's what I had to do:","Manage the whole operation (all the administrative tasks included)","Coach three speakers (out of six)","Social media management (FB, Twitter, Instagram)","Here are the main \"one-time\" tasks I have done:","Contacted TED and got the licence for more than 100 attendees","Found the speakers","Obtained the support of our state (educational department)","Contacted one of the two schools and personally presented the project to them","Introduced the event and the speakers on stage with one of my colleague.","My friends did a great job through all of this and I can't thank them enough for their motivation and engagement.

We organized that event over 2 years. There were many challenges, including compliance with COVID standards and the fact that schools were not allowed to go on field trips because of COVID. To counteract this, we decided to open the doors to the general public for the first time, which meant that we had to increase our efforts to bring people in. This kind of event is a hard sell in times of COVID and at the time of revival of social events. Still, we managed to gather over 100 people on the D-Day.","Again, I was in charge of the administration:","Direction of the organization of the event","License Management","Guest management / Networking","Volunteer Management","Social media accounts management","Marketing","Management and coaching of a few speakers","Relationship management with the parent TEDx: the TEDxMartigny managed by Neurhone","As well as other tasks:","On-stage presentation of speakers","Creating the program","Stage director"]},{"i":"what-i-personally-learned-that-year","l":":icon-bookmark: What I personally learned that year","p":["Knowing how to delegate more is important, otherwise it is easy to overload yourself and not be able to give your 100% in each task that requires a great effort.","You have to be ready on all fronts on D-Day and anticipate all the cases that may arise."]}],[{"l":"Accomplishments"},{"l":"Licences and cetifications","p":["In March 2022, I passed the CAE (Cambridge English Advanced) exam and obtained 205 points, equivalent to the C2 level.","During 2016, I followed several months of courses spread over the year at Canal9, the local television of Valais.
