# General equilibrium
## 1. Partial equilibrium
### I. (a) Partial competitive equilibrium (on 1 market)

#### 1. Introduction to Market Equilibrium
- Definition: Market equilibrium occurs when supply equals demand, determining the price and quantity in a market.
- Purpose: To understand the origins of prices, their fluctuations, and the role of prices in resource allocation.

#### 2. Reminder: Political Economics I
- **Demand Curve**: Each point represents the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">marginal benefit</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">maximum willingness to pay (WTP)</mark>.
- **Aggregate Demand**: Summation of individual demand curves.
- **Supply Curve**: Each point indicates the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">marginal cost</mark> or <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">minimum willingness to accept (WTA)</mark>.
- **Aggregate Supply**: Summation of individual supply curves.
- Concepts of perfectly elastic and inelastic demand and supply.
	- Perfectly elastic demand: Digital music downloads w/ each supplier the same price
	- Perfectly inelastic demand: Life-saving drug without substitute
	- Perfectly elastic supply: Electricity
	- Perfectly inelastic supply: Original work of art

#### 3. Short-Term Partial Equilibrium in a Perfect Market
- **Perfect Market Assumptions**: *(does not exist)*
  - <u>Producers</u> (Supply) maximize profit, sell identical products, have free entry/exit, and no market power.
  - <u>Consumers</u> (Demand) maximize utility and have no market power.
  - <u>Market</u> features perfect information, no transaction costs, full cost accounting, and well-defined property rights.
- Economists' roles include understanding market forces and correcting market failures like imperfect competition, information asymmetry, externalities, transaction costs, poorly defined property rights, limited rationality, and inequalities.
- Perfect market $\to$ <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">competitive equilibrium maximises welfare</mark> + <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Pareto efficient</mark>

#### 4. Economic Efficiency
- **Equilibrium in Perfect Competition**:
  - Achieved when supply equals demand ($P^* = Q^*$).
  - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">All opportunities for exchange are exhausted.</mark>
- **Partial competitive equilibrium (PC)**:
	- $P(Q^*)=MC(Q^*)$
- **Pareto Efficiency**: A state where resources cannot be reallocated to improve someone's well-being <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without worsening someone else's</mark>.
	- Eg: Crossing the road with bike without having to get off it
- **Profit at** $(P^*, Q^*)$:
	- Revenue = $P^* \cdot Q^*$
	- Total cost = Area under MC curve (supply)
	- Profit = Revenue - Total cost
- **Consumer and Producer Surplus**:
  - Consumer Surplus: Difference between total benefit and total amount paid.
	  - $CS = ΣD(Q) - P\cdot Q$
  - Producer Surplus: Difference between total revenue and total cost.
	  - $PS = P \cdot Q - ΣS(Q)$
  - Total well-being is maximized at competitive equilibrium.
	  - $WB = CS + π$
- **Economic efficiency**:
	- = maximising well-being
		- $\implies$ Competitive equilibrium maximises well-being
- **Competitive equilibrium**:
	- Decentralised way of achieving economic efficiency (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Invisible Hand</mark>)
	- Is Pareto efficient (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">First well-being theorem</mark>)

#### 5. Long-Term Partial Equilibrium in a Perfect Market (Special case)
- **Short term profit is positive**
	- Free entry & exit, $PS > 0 \implies$ other companies will enter the market
	- New total supply curve $\to$ aggregate supply curve will become flat as the long-term supply
- **Long-Term Equilibrium**:
  - Short-term producer surplus attracts
  - New entrants, shifting the supply curve until $PS = 0$. (<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">perfectly elastic long-term supply curve</mark>)
  - Long-term equilibrium price equals marginal cost.
  - Any company that can generate a surplus enters the market ($P^* =MC$, constant)
- **Real-World Considerations**:
  - Barriers to entry, such as natural, institutional, and technological factors, restrict market entry and allow for economic profit.
  - Fixed costs, although ignored in the theoretical model, play a significant role in real-world market dynamics.

#### Main Concepts and Examples

1. **Market Equilibrium**
   - **Definition**: The state where market supply and demand balance each other, resulting in stable prices.
   - **Example**: In a local farmers' market, the price of apples stabilizes at $1 per pound when the quantity supplied matches the quantity demanded.

2. **Demand Curve**
   - **Definition**: A graph showing the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
   - **Example**: A consumer is willing to pay up to $5 for the first unit of a product, $4 for the second, and so on, reflecting diminishing marginal utility.

3. **Supply Curve**
   - **Definition**: A graph showing the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.
   - **Example**: A producer is willing to sell the first unit of a product at a minimum of $2, the second unit at $3, and so forth, reflecting increasing marginal cost.

4. **Aggregate Demand and Supply**
   - **Definition**: The total demand or supply in a market, aggregated from individual curves.
   - **Example**: In a city, the aggregate demand for public transportation is the sum of individual demands from all commuters.

5. **Pareto Efficiency**
   - **Definition**: A resource allocation state where no individual's well-being can be improved without reducing someone else's well-being.
   - **Example**: In a classroom, redistributing resources so that one student gets more textbooks without taking any away from others represents a Pareto improvement.

6. **Consumer and Producer Surplus**
   - **Definition**: Measures of economic benefit. Consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. Producer surplus is the difference between what producers receive and their costs.
   - **Example**: If a consumer pays $3 for a coffee they value at $5, their consumer surplus is $2. If the producer’s cost is $1, their surplus is $2.

7. **Perfect Market Assumptions**
   - **Definition**: Conditions under which markets operate perfectly without failures.
   - **Example**: In a theoretical perfect market, all farmers sell identical crops, have complete market information, and face no barriers to entering or leaving the market.

8. **Long-Term Equilibrium**
   - **Definition**: The state in which all economic profits are zero due to free entry and exit in the market.
   - **Example**: In the tech industry, if new firms keep entering due to high short-term profits, eventually competition will drive profits down to zero.
### I. (b) Taxation in partial equilibrium

1.  **Income Inequality and the Role of Government**

    *   Significant disparity in global wealth distribution, with a small percentage of the population owning a disproportionately large share of the wealth.
    *   Raises questions about the government's role in addressing this inequality, particularly through taxation and social programs.

2.  **Taxation in Partial Equilibrium: Algebraic Approach**

    - $max_{E,Y}U(E,Y) \text{ s.t. } p \cdot E + Y ≤ W$
    - Optimisation under constraint: $max_{E,Y} L(E,Y) = U(E,Y) - \lambda (p\cdot E+Y-W)$
	    - FOC $\implies \lambda = 1, \space P(E)=1-E$
	- Profit = $p \cdot E - c(E)$
		- Profit maximisation under PC: $max_{E}\space p \cdot E - c(E)$
			- FOC: $p- \frac{\partial c(E)}{\partial E}= p-cm(E)=0$
			- Supply curve is $cm(E)$
			- Equilibrium: $D=S\implies P(E)=cm(E)$
	- Case 1: Impact on consumers
		- Unit tax: consumer pay to the gov
			- $max_{E,Y}U(E,Y) \text{ s.t. } (p+\textcolor{red}{t}) \cdot E + Y ≤ W$
			- $P'(E)= P(E)-t$
	- Case 2: Impact on producers
		- $max_{E}\space (p-\textcolor{red}{t}) \cdot E - c(E)$
		- $p=cm(E)+\textcolor{red}{t}$
	- Case 1 v. Case 2
		- It's the same equation
	- **Special Cases**:
		- <u>Perfectly Inelastic Supply</u>: Supply does not move, consumer price remains unchanged, producer bears all the tax.
		- <u>Perfectly Elastic Supply</u>: Consumer price increases by the tax amount, equilibrium quantity falls sharply.
		- <u>Perfectly Elastic Demand</u>: Consumer price remains unchanged, producer bears all the tax.
		- <u>Perfectly Inelastic Demand</u>: Consumer price increases by the tax amount, equilibrium quantity remains unchanged.


3.  **Taxation in Partial Equilibrium: Graphical Approach**

	- **Tax on Goods and Services:**
		- Two types: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unit tax</mark> (specific amount per unit) and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">value-added tax</mark> (percentage of price).
	- **Impact on Perfect Competition:**
		- Tax creates a difference between the price the consumer pays and the price the producer receives.
		- Legal impact vs. economic impact: who legally pays the tax may differ from who economically bears the tax burden.
		- Tax reduces overall well-being, leading to a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">deadweight loss</mark>.

**Main Concepts**
1. **Partial Equilibrium**

	- Definition: Analysis of a single market in isolation, ignoring feedbacks from other markets.
	- Example: Evaluating the effect of a tax on gasoline without considering its impact on the broader economy.

2. **Tax Incidence**

	- Definition: The distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers.
	- Example: In a market with inelastic supply, producers bear most of the tax burden as they cannot easily reduce quantity supplied.

3. **Deadweight Loss**

	- Definition: A loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium outcome is not achieved.
	- Example: A tax on sugary drinks leads to reduced consumption, but the loss in consumer and producer surplus exceeds the tax revenue collected

4. **Elasticity:** 
	- A measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in price.

**Examples**

- **Partial Equilibrium**

	- Example: Suppose the government imposes a $1 tax per liter on petrol. In partial equilibrium analysis, we only look at the petrol market. If the initial price was $3 per liter and the tax is added, the new price might be $3.80 per liter (assuming producers absorb part of the tax), affecting only this market.

- **Tax Incidence**

	- Example: If a tax is levied on a luxury car, and the demand for luxury cars is highly elastic, consumers are sensitive to price changes. Thus, the producer will bear most of the tax burden, reducing the net price received.

- **Deadweight Loss**

	- Example: Introducing a tax on tobacco results in decreased consumption. While the government earns revenue from the tax, the reduction in consumer and producer surplus (people buying less tobacco and producers selling less) represents a deadweight loss.

*   **Elasticity:** 
	* Example: The demand for luxury goods is generally more elastic than the demand for necessities, meaning that a tax on luxury goods would likely lead to a larger decrease in quantity demanded compared to a tax on necessities.
## 2. Equilibrium in a monopoly market
### 1. Equilibrium in a Monopoly Market
- **Definition of Monopoly**: A situation with only one company in the market, where the quantity offered by the company determines the selling price.
- **Market Structure**:
  - **Perfect Competition**: Identical goods, price taken as given.
  - **Imperfect Competition**: 
	  - <u>Monopolistic competition</u>: A market structure where many companies sell products that are similar but not identical. Each company has some market power to set prices for its own product due to differentiation.
	  - <u>Oligopoly</u>: A market structure characterized by a small number of firms that dominate the market. These firms have significant control over prices and their decisions are interdependent.
	  - <u>Monopoly with differentiated or strategic pricing</u>: A market where a single company (monopoly) sets prices strategically, often using product differentiation to maximize profits and control the market.
		  - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Endogenous pricing</mark>
- **Examples of Monopolies**: La Poste, OPEC, Microsoft, Walmart, Taylor Swift, Aéroport de Cointrin, Pfizer, CFF, Swissgrid, Swissair (historically), De Beers, SAQ/SQDC.
- **Monopoly problem**
	- Single good $Q$
	- Single market, well-defined demand $P(Q) = a-bQ\to$ linear
	- Single price
	- **Profit maximisation**: $\max_{Q}\underbrace{  P(Q) \cdot Q}_{ \text{revenue} }  - \underbrace{ C(Q) }_{ \text{cost} }$
		- Difference with PC: $P(Q)$ <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">endogenous</mark> price $\neq$ $P$ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exogenous</mark> price
			- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Endogenous</mark>: determined entirely by the company (factors within the model or system)
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Exogenous</mark>: determined entirely by the market equilibrium condition (outside the model)
	- **FOC**: $P’(Q) \cdot Q + P(Q) - C’(Q)=0$
		- When you sell one more unit, there are two opposing effects:
			(+) Additional revenue from additional units sold 
			(-) Lost revenue due to price cuts on all units sold
	- **Solution**: $\underbrace{ \underbrace{ P’(Q) }_{ <0 } \cdot Q + P(Q) }_{ \text{marginal revenue} } = \underbrace{ C’(Q) }_{ \text{marginal cost} }$
		- PC: $P(Q)= C'(Q)$
	- **Marginal income:** $MC=P\left( 1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{QP}} \right)$
		- Function of the elasticity of demand
	- **Price elasticity of demand**: 
	  $E_{Q_{P}} = \frac{\Delta Q / Q}{\Delta P / P} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \cdot \frac{P}{\Delta P} = \frac{\text{\% change in price}}{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\cdot{\frac{P}{Q}}$
	- **Lerner index**: $\frac{P-Cm}{P}= \frac{1}{|\epsilon_{QP}|}$
		- Profit (markup): $P-MC$
		- Measures the monopolist's degree of market power - the ability to set the price above marginal cost
		- The lower the elasticity (i.e., more inelastic demand), the higher the Lerner Index
		- With inelastic demand, a monopoly has greater pricing power and can set a higher markup over marginal cost, enhancing its ability to extract consumer surplus and increase profits.

### 2. Monopoly Deadweight Loss
- **Profit Maximization**:
  - Revenue: \( $P(Q) \cdot Q$ \)
  - Cost: \( $C(Q)$ \)
  - First Order Condition: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Marginal Revenue (MR) = Marginal Cost (MC)</mark>
- **Monopoly vs. Perfect Competition**:
  - Monopoly sets prices where MR = MC.
  - Perfect competition sets prices where market equilibrium condition holds.
- **Deadweight Loss**: Created due to underproduction and artificial scarcity, resulting in higher prices and lower consumer surplus.

### 3. Natural Monopoly
- **Definition**: Occurs when a single company can supply the entire market demand at a lower cost than multiple companies due to significant economies of scale.
- **Examples**: Electricity transmission, water supply, motorways.
- **Regulatory Approaches**:
  - Force competition.
  - Price = Marginal Cost + Subsidy.
  - Regulate return on investment.
  - Set maximum prices.

### 4. Measuring Market Power
- **Historical Context**: Example of Standard Oil and its monopoly practices, leading to antitrust actions.
- **Detection of Anti-Competitive Practices**:
  - Explicit collusion in pricing, production quotas, and technology.
  - Tacit collusion, indicated by price convergence and coordinated decision-making.
- **Role of Economists**: Evaluate mergers and acquisitions to prevent monopoly rents using complex models.

### Main Concepts and Examples

#### 1. Monopoly
- **Definition**: A market structure where a single company controls the entire market supply.
- **Example**: De Beers controlling diamond supply to maintain high prices.

#### 2. Deadweight Loss
- **Definition**: The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss of economic efficiency</mark> when the equilibrium outcome is not achievable or not achieved.
- **Example**: A monopoly reducing output to increase prices, leading to a loss in total surplus.

#### 3. Natural Monopoly
- **Definition**: A market where a single firm can produce at a lower cost than multiple firms due to high fixed costs and significant economies of scale.
- **Example**: Electricity grid, where a single infrastructure serves the entire market at a lower cost than multiple competing infrastructures.

#### 4. Marginal Cost Pricing with Subsidy
- **Definition**: Setting prices equal to marginal cost and subsidizing the firm to cover the difference between average cost and marginal cost.
- **Example**: Government setting water supply prices at marginal cost and subsidizing the water company to ensure it covers its costs.

#### 5. Anti-Competitive Practices
- **Definition**: Strategies employed by firms to reduce competition, maintain or increase prices, and secure market power.
- **Example**: Hoffmann-La Roche and other pharmaceutical companies forming a cartel to fix vitamin prices.

### Examples Illustrating Concepts

#### Monopoly
- **Illustration**: A single railway company controlling all tracks and train services in a region, setting high prices due to lack of competition.

#### Deadweight Loss
- **Illustration**: A monopolist pharmaceutical company producing fewer drugs than the socially optimal quantity, resulting in higher prices and lost consumer welfare.

#### Natural Monopoly
- **Illustration**: A single company managing all electricity transmission lines in a country, reducing the average cost per unit transmitted compared to having multiple companies.

#### Marginal Cost Pricing with Subsidy
- **Illustration**: A public transportation system setting ticket prices equal to the cost of one additional passenger, with government subsidies covering the fixed operational costs.

#### Anti-Competitive Practices
- **Illustration**: Two leading smartphone manufacturers agreeing to set minimum prices for their products, reducing consumer choices and keeping prices high.
## 3. Externality

### 1. Introduction to Externalities and Market Failures
- **Definition of Externality**: An externality occurs when a transaction between two economic agents <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">impacts a third party not involved</mark> in the transaction, and this impact is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">not reflected in market prices</mark>.
- **Environmental Problems**: Often arise due to undefined property rights and incomplete markets, leading to free access and lack of responsibility.
- **Market Failures**: Externalities and public goods contribute to market failures, particularly in environmental contexts.

### 2. Concept of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Pigouvian Taxation</mark>
- **Purpose**: To <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">correct market failures by internalizing externalities</mark> through taxation.
- **Optimal Tax**: Under specific conditions, there exists an optimal tax that can achieve the "First-Best" solution, i.e., the most efficient allocation of resources.

### 3. Simplified Economy Model
- **Two Goods**: Food (E) and a composite good (Y).
- **Competitive Markets**: Assumed for both goods, where prices are equal to marginal costs. ($P=Mc$)
- **Representative Consumer**: Optimization is constrained using the Lagrangian method.

### 4. Government Intervention and Social Planning
- **Externalities**: Consumption of food (E) produces methane emissions, causing damage not directly borne by consumers.
- **Social Planner's Problem**: Formulating a solution to achieve social equilibrium by considering externalities.
- **First-Best Solution**: Achieved when the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">marginal benefit equals the marginal social cost</mark>.

### 5. Graphical Analysis
- **Demand and Supply Curves**: Inverse demand curve ($P(E)$) and supply curve.
- **Competitive vs Social Equilibrium**: Comparison of the equilibrium under competitive markets versus socially optimal equilibrium.
- **Marginal Damage Curve**: Represents the additional harm caused by each unit of E consumed.

### 6. Pigouvian Tax Implementation
- **Decentralized Solution**: Taxation does not require knowledge of utility or production functions, only the marginal damage function.
- **Applicability**: Relevant in contexts with externalities, including pollution, COVID-19, financial market risks, and R&D spill-overs.
- **Examples**:
  - **Finland**: First carbon tax implemented in 1990.
  - **Switzerland**: Introduced carbon tax in 2008.
  - **British Columbia (Canada)**: Implemented a revenue-neutral carbon tax.

### 7. Comparative Analysis
- **Competitive Equilibrium vs Social Welfare**: Evaluates the total private cost, damage, consumer benefit, and welfare under competitive equilibrium and social equilibrium.
- **Dead-Weight Loss (DWL)**: Analysis of inefficiencies in competitive equilibrium compared to the socially optimal state.

### Main Concepts and Examples

1. **Externality**:
   - **Definition**: A cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially incurred or received by that producer.
   - **Example**: A factory emitting pollution affects the health of nearby residents, who are not compensated for this harm.

2. **Pigouvian Tax**:
   - **Definition**: A tax imposed on activities that generate negative externalities to correct the market outcome.
   - **Example**: A carbon tax imposed on industries based on their carbon emissions to reduce overall pollution levels.

3. **First-Best Solution**:
   - **Definition**: An optimal allocation of resources where marginal benefits equal marginal social costs.
   - **Example**: Adjusting production levels in an industry to ensure the additional benefit of producing one more unit equals the additional cost imposed on society.

4. **Dead-Weight Loss (DWL)**:
   - **Definition**: The loss of economic efficiency when equilibrium for a good or service is not achieved.
   - **Example**: In the absence of a Pigouvian tax, the overproduction of polluting goods leads to societal costs that exceed the private benefits, creating a DWL.
## 4. Good to know

  - Quantity (Qmonopoly) <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">lower</mark> than in competitive markets
- **Deadweight Loss**: Represented by areas C and E in the graph.

### 5. Natural Monopoly
- **Key Points**: Focuses on the cost structure where one firm can supply the market at a lower cost than multiple firms.
- **Graphical Analysis**:
  - Average Cost (AC) and Marginal Cost (Cm) curves
  - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Profit determination based on the intersection of AC and demand curve</mark>

### 6. Externalities and Pigouvian Tax
- **Externalities**: Costs or benefits not reflected in market prices that affect third parties.
- **Deadweight Loss**: Due to externalities, illustrated in the graph.
- **Pigouvian Tax**: A tax imposed to correct the negative externalities by aligning private costs with social costs.

### Main Concepts and Examples

1. **Perfect Market**:
   - **Definition**: A market structure characterized by perfect competition where no participant has the market power to influence prices.
   - **Example**: Agricultural markets where numerous farmers sell identical products and none can influence the market price.

2. **Competitive Equilibrium**:
   - **Definition**: The point where the supply and demand curves intersect, maximizing total well-being.
   - **Example**: The equilibrium price and quantity of apples in a market where many buyers and sellers operate.

3. **Deadweight Loss**:
   - **Definition**: The loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the equilibrium for a good or service is not achieved.
   - **Example**: Imposing a tax on cigarettes may reduce consumption but also creates a deadweight loss due to the loss of well-being from both consumers and producers.

4. **Monopoly**:
   - **Definition**: A market structure where a single firm controls the entire market supply and sets prices above marginal costs.
   - **Example**: A local utility company that is the sole provider of electricity in a region.

5. **Natural Monopoly**:
   - **Definition**: A type of monopoly that arises due to high fixed costs and economies of scale, making it more efficient for one firm to supply the entire market.
   - **Example**: The water supply industry, where infrastructure costs make it inefficient for multiple firms to operate.

6. **Externalities**:
   - **Definition**: Economic side effects or consequences that affect uninvolved third parties; can be positive or negative.
   - **Example**: Pollution from a factory affecting the health of nearby residents.

7. **Pigouvian Tax**:
   - **Definition**: A tax levied on any market activity that generates negative externalities (costs not internalized in the market price).
   - **Example**: Carbon tax imposed on companies based on their greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change effects.
## 5.  General equilibrium
### 1. Introduction and Key Concepts
- **Equilibrium in Economics**
  - **Partial Competitive Equilibrium**: Focuses on a single market under perfect conditions.
  - **General Competitive Equilibrium**: Involves multiple markets interacting with each other.
  - **Perfect Market Assumptions**: Profit maximization by producers, identical products, free entry/exit, no market power, perfect information, no transaction costs, all costs accounted for, well-defined property rights.

### 2. Interactions Between Multiple Markets
- **Example 1: Energy Crisis in Europe**
  - Reduction in natural gas supply impacts the equilibrium price.
  - Increased demand for heat pumps due to higher gas prices.
  - Feedback effect as widespread adoption of heat pumps reduces long-term gas demand.
  
- **Example 2: Consumers as Producers**
  - Consumers who are also entrepreneurs with capital.
  - Increased capital productivity lowers costs, increases demand.
  - Entrepreneurs work more to meet demand, become richer, changing consumption patterns.

### 3. The Edgeworth Box
- **Definition and Use**
  - Graphical tool for studying general equilibrium with two goods and two types of consumer/producer.
  - Illustrates initial allocations, final allocations, and potential Pareto efficiency improvements.
  
- **Key Concepts Illustrated**
  - **Initial Allocations**: Starting allocation of goods for consumers.
  - **Final Allocations**: Allocation after trade based on preferences.
  - **Pareto Efficiency**: No one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
  - **Contract Curve**: All Pareto-efficient allocations.

### 4. Walras' General Equilibrium
- **General Equilibrium Definition**
  - All agents optimize their utility.
  - Prices adjust so that total demand equals total supply.
  
- **Walras' Auctioneer**
  - Hypothetical figure adjusting prices to achieve equilibrium.
  
- **Market Adjustments**
  - Prices are endogenous; budget constraints depend on relative prices.
  - General equilibrium ensures that net demand equals zero.

### 5. The First Welfare Theorem
- **Statement**
  - All Walras competitive equilibria are Pareto efficient.
  - Equilibrium is on the contract curve.

### 6. The Second Welfare Theorem
- **Statement**
  - Any Pareto optimum can be a Walras equilibrium if resources are adequately reallocated.
  
- **Implications**
  - Initial allocations impact the set of achievable equilibria.
  - Redistribution of resources can reach different equilibria on the contract curve.

### 7. Practical Applications of General Equilibrium
- **Examples**
  - Liberalization of electricity markets.
  - Allocation of medical student placements.
  - Allocation of computing servers in the cloud.
  - Creation of carbon markets.

### Main Concepts and Examples

1. **Partial Competitive Equilibrium**
   - **Concept**: Equilibrium in a single market under perfect conditions.
   - **Example**: A perfectly competitive market for apples where all producers sell identical apples, and no single producer can influence the price.

2. **General Competitive Equilibrium**
   - **Concept**: Equilibrium across multiple markets where all markets and agents interact.
   - **Example**: Interaction between the natural gas market and the heat pump market during an energy crisis.

3. **Pareto Efficiency**
   - **Concept**: An allocation where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
   - **Example**: In a trade between two countries, if both countries cannot improve their well-being without reducing the other’s well-being, the allocation is Pareto efficient.

4. **Walras' General Equilibrium**
   - **Concept**: A state where all markets are in equilibrium simultaneously, with supply equaling demand across all markets.
   - **Example**: An economy where the prices of all goods adjust so that the amount of goods consumers want to buy equals the amount producers want to sell.

5. **The First Welfare Theorem**
   - **Concept**: Any competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient.
   - **Example**: In a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium price and quantity will be Pareto efficient, ensuring maximum welfare.

6. **The Second Welfare Theorem**
   - **Concept**: Any Pareto-efficient allocation can be achieved through some competitive equilibrium, given appropriate redistribution of initial endowments.
   - **Example**: Redistribution of initial wealth in a society to achieve a desired Pareto-efficient allocation without sacrificing efficiency.

### Conclusion
This chapter outlines fundamental economic theories related to market equilibrium, both in single and multiple market scenarios, and emphasizes the concepts of Pareto efficiency and general equilibrium, using graphical tools like the Edgeworth Box. Practical applications of these theories are also discussed, highlighting their relevance in various economic policies and market structures.

- **Excess Demand**: $Z_i = D_i(P) - S_i(P)$
- **Walras' Law**: $$\sum_{i=1}^n P_i Z_i = 0$$

#### First Welfare Theorem

- **Pareto Efficiency**: An allocation is Pareto efficient if there is no other allocation that makes some individuals better off without making anyone worse off.
- **Utility Maximization**: $$\text{Maximize } U_i(x_i) \text{ subject to } \sum_{j} p_j x_{ij} \leq w_i$$ for all consumers $i$

#### Second Welfare Theorem

- **Any Pareto Optimum**: Can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium with appropriate lump-sum transfers.
- **Reallocation**: Initial endowments can be adjusted to achieve different Pareto-efficient outcomes.

### Additional Formulas

- **Budget Constraint**: $$\sum_{i} p_i x_i = I$$
  where $p_i$ is the price of good $i$, $x_i$ is the quantity of good $i$, and $I$ is the income.
  
- **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**: $$MRS = \frac{\partial U / \partial x_1}{\partial U / \partial x_2}$$
  
- **Price Ratio in Equilibrium**: $$\frac{p_x}{p_y} = MRS$$

>**Walras optimum:**
>- All agents (consumers and producers) maximize their utility or profit given their budget constraints.
> - Market prices adjust so that the total supply equals total demand for all goods, achieving general equilibrium.
>  - The allocation of resources is Pareto efficient, meaning no individual can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
