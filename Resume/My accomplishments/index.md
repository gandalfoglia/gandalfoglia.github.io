||| Course certificate at Canal9
During 2016, I followed several months of courses spread over the year at Canal9, the local television of Valais. I learned how to make a report for the television news (preparation, shooting, editing). The course included theoretical classes, practical exercises and an end of year project (a report) in order to apply all our knowledge.
