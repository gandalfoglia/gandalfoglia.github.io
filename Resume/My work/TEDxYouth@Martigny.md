# TEDxYouth@Martigny

## How It Started
My TEDx journey began at TEDxMartigny, where I started as a volunteer. Following a successful 2018 edition, I joined the committee to delve deeper into the intricacies of organizing such an event. 

During the first meeting of 2019, the committee proposed that I organize a TEDxYouth event, offering their financial and structural support. I hesitantly accepted, feeling both excited and apprehensive about the challenge.

I invited three close friends to join this adventure, and we began our search for speakers.

## The First Edition (2019)
We successfully coached and prepared six remarkable individuals, aged 16 to 21, for the event.

The event was scheduled for the afternoon of September 6th, just before TEDxMartigny. With the cooperation of local schools, I presented a speech that shared ideas worth spreading with 250 students aged 14 to 19. Despite a ten-minute delay at the start, the event went smoothly. The positive feedback from the schools, eager to return the following year, was our most rewarding compliment.

Held at the Alambic Theater, the show lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes. It was a memorable Friday, and with the school's permission, we were able to skip classes for the day.

### My Responsibilities
- Managed the entire operation, including administrative tasks
- Coached three out of six speakers
- Handled social media management (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)

### Key One-Time Tasks
- Secured a license from TED for over 100 attendees
- Selected and coached speakers
- Gained support from the stateâ€™s educational department
- Presented the project to one of the schools
- Co-hosted the event and introduced speakers on stage with a colleague

My friends played a crucial role, and their motivation and commitment were invaluable. This project truly showcased the power of teamwork.

- Don't be afraid to ask. Often, things work out well, and even after refusals, life goes on.

## The Second Edition (2021)
Due to COVID-19, we had to skip the 2020 edition and organized the next event over two years. The challenges were numerous, including adhering to COVID-19 protocols and schools' restrictions on field trips. To address this, we opened the event to the general public for the first time, increasing our efforts to attract attendees. Despite the difficulties, we managed to gather over 100 people on the event day.

Again, I took charge of administration:
- Directed the organization of the event
- Managed licensing
- Oversaw guest management and networking
- Coordinated volunteer efforts
- Managed social media accounts
- Handled marketing
- Coached several speakers
- Maintained relations with the parent TEDx organization, TEDxMartigny, managed by Neurhone

### Additional Tasks
- Presented speakers on stage
- Created the event program
- Directed the stage operations

=== :icon-bookmark: What I Learned in 2021
- Delegating tasks is crucial to avoid overloading yourself, ensuring you can give 100% to tasks that require significant effort.
- Being prepared for all eventualities on the event day and anticipating potential issues is essential.
