# TEDxYouth@Martigny

## How it started
My TEDx journey started at TEDxMartigny, as a volunteer. After a successful 2018 edition of the event, I joined their committee to learn more about the whole process of organizing an event. 

At the first meeting of the year 2019, the committee asked me if I wanted to organize a TEDxYouth event with their financial and structural support. I'm happy I said yes, even though it sounded really scary at the time.

I brought three good friends on this journey and then we started searching for speakers. 

## The first edition (2019)
We got six wonderful people (aged 16 to 21) to coach and prepare for the event.

Our event had to take place in the afternoon of the 6th of September as the TEDxMartigny took place later on. So I presented a speech to local schools and with their great cooperation we shared ideas worth spreading to 250 students aged 14 to 19. Everything went well (except the fact that we started the show ten minutes late) and those schools wanted to do it again the following year! The most beautiful compliment they could tell us.

The event took place at the Alambic theater and the show was 1 hour and 30 minutes long.

It was a Friday and hopefully we have been able to skip school for that day (with the authorization of the direction, of course).

Here's what I had to do:
- Manage the whole operation
- Coach three speakers (out of six)
- All the administrative tasks
- Social media management (FB, Twitter, Instagram)

Here are the main one-time tasks I have done:
- Contacted TED and got the licence for more than 100 attendees
- Found the speakers
- Obtained the support of our state (educational department)
- Contacted one of the two schools and personally presented the project to them
- Introduced the event and the speakers on stage with one of my colleague.

My friends did a great job through all of this and I can't thank them enough for their motivation and engagement. None of this would have been possible without teamwork.

- You should not be afraid to ask. Very often things work out well. Even after a refusal, life goes on.

## The second edition (2021)

Because of COVID, we had to skip a year and organized the event over 2 years. There were many challenges, including compliance with COVID standards and the fact that schools were not allowed to go on field trips. To counteract this, we decided to open the doors to the general public for the first time, which meant that we had to increase our efforts to bring people in. This kind of event is a hard sell in times of COVID and the revival of social events, but we still managed to gather over 100 people on the D-Day. 

I'm was charge of the administration:
- Direction of the organization of the event
- License Management
- Guest management / Networking
- Volunteer Management
- Social media accounts management
- Marketing
- Management and coaching of a few speakers
- Relationship management with the parent TEDx: the TEDxMartigny managed by Neurhone

As well as other tasks:
- On-stage presentation of speakers
- Creating the program
- Stage director

=== :icon-bookmark: What I personally learned that year
- Knowing how to delegate more is important, otherwise it is easy to overload yourself and not be able to give your 100% in each task that requires a great effort.
- You have to be ready on all fronts on D-Day and anticipate all the cases that may arise.
